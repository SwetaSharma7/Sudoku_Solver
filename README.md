A Sudoku solver implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a backtracking algorithm allows users to input an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and receive a solution in real-time. The user interface is created using HTML and styled with CSS for a visually appealing layout. JavaScript is utilized to handle user interactions, validate inputs, and implement the backtracking algorithm for solving the Sudoku puzzle.

The backtracking algorithm systematically explores possible number placements in the puzzle's empty cells. It attempts to place numbers from 1 to 9 in each cell, checking if the placement adheres to Sudoku rules (no duplicate numbers in rows, columns, or 3x3 subgrids). If a placement violates the rules, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number until a valid solution is found.

The solver provides an interactive experience, displaying each step of the backtracking process, highlighting cells that are being considered, and allowing users to visualize the solution as it unfolds. Once a valid solution is found, it is displayed on the interface, completing the Sudoku puzzle.

This implementation showcases the power of using web technologies to create an engaging and educational tool for solving Sudoku puzzles, while also demonstrating the effectiveness of the backtracking algorithm for solving complex logical puzzles.
